\subsection{Astar}
Algorithm~\ref{astar} describes Astar search, a type of best-first search which uses a heuristic to gauge the distance to the goal, $h$, and adds it to the path cost, $g$, to choose the next node to expand, that is, the direction that seems most likely to reach the goal first.
Astar uses a priority queue implemented on a heap to sort the best potential nodes on the frontier.
The heap stores tuples for each frontier node which take the form $(heuristic cost ~ [g + h], g, [frontierState.parent, frontierState])$.
When a node is chosen, it is removed from the queue and added to the \textit{path} where the node is the key an the parent is the value (the parent is already a key in the map pointing to it's parent).
When we find the goal, we travel up the map collecting the path using the path reconstruction function given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:reconstructpath}.
